The expression `globals()[class_name](**value)` is a dynamic way
to create an instance of a class based on the class name
provided in the variable class_name, and it passes keyword
arguments stored in the value dictionary to the class constructor.

Let's break it down:

globals(): Returns a dictionary representing the global symbol
table, which includes all global variables, functions, and classes.

The global symbol table in Python is a dictionary that holds information about the current global scope. It maps the names of variables (including functions and classes) to their corresponding objects in the global namespace.

When you define a variable or a function at the top level of your Python script or module, it becomes part of the global namespace, and its name is stored in the global symbol table. This allows Python to keep track of the names and their associated objects so that they can be looked up when referenced in the code.

`globals()[class_name]`: Retrieves the value associated with the
key class_name in the global symbol table. In the context of your
code, this should be a class (since you're using it to create an
instance).

`globals()[class_name](**value)`: Calls the class constructor with
the keyword arguments stored in the value dictionary. The \*\*value
syntax is used for unpacking the dictionary and passing its
key-value pairs as keyword arguments to the constructor.

```python
# Suppose class_name is "BaseModel" and value is {"name": "John", "age": 30}

class_name = "BaseModel"
value = {"name": "John", "age": 30}

# This line dynamically creates an instance of the class "BaseModel" with the specified keyword arguments
instance = globals()[class_name](**value)

# Equivalent to:
# instance = BaseModel(name="John", age=30)
```

In this example, BaseModel is assumed to be a class defined in your code. The `globals()\[class_name]` expression dynamically retrieves the class, and \*\*value passes the keyword arguments to the constructor.

This dynamic instantiation can be useful in scenarios where you need to create an instance of a class based on runtime information, such as user input or configuration data. However, it's important to handle potential errors, like checking if the class exists in the global symbol table.
